# Assignment11.1
This assignment focuses on using filters for ASP.NET

Download the Assignment 6.1 project folder and Assignment 6.1 solution file. This assignment creates a Web API for the CRUD actions performed in last week's assignment. Moreover, the API uses filters to catch bad requests. Each error that occurs in the People database with respect to the server will be appropriately logged in a new table in the pre-existing database. 
Because this assignment once again uses a local db, please reinitialize and update the database through the package manager:
In the PM Console:
1) Add-Migration "InitialSchema"
2) Update-Database
